# Speedrail

Application template for starting new rails applications with the technologies I like.

Includes:

1. Rails 5
  - Bootstrap 3
2. Testing (with RSpec)
  - Capybara configured for feature tests
  - Factory Girl
  - Pry

## Future developments

Currently this is just plain rails app with couple cleanup & added gems. Cleaner solution would be to package it as a gem and provide generators with configurations.

Features to add:
  - [ ] instead of hard copy, see how it could be implemented using rails generators
  - [ ] automatic CI integration
  - [ ] setting application name
